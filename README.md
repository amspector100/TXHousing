## Structure and Documentation

Almost all of the Python code lives inside the TXHousing python package, which is structured into three subpackages:
 "utilities", "data_processing", and "analysis". The utilities and data_processing packages are full of helper functions which
help streamline the code in the analysis package. For documentation of every function in the TXHousing package, see
 {} (to be inserted).
